# DISCLAIMER
Prima came to be during what I dubbed the October crash. If you were involved with the more speculative side of the market, you'd perhaps get caught in the cliff dive as well. It wasn't enough for me to understand incentives and mandates and policy movement. Even though I might be right on all those, the market still clears in price — and price ultimately, is a derivative of both greed and fear. I needed something that demonstrates structure, plumbing — the difference between a temporary correction and narrative decay or full on risk-off appetite.

Thus, Prima.

Prima is not a trading signal, a volatility proxy, or a crash predictor. It exists simply to observe stress. One should think of Prima as a forensic lens, not an actionable instruction manual.

# LOGIC AND RATIONALE
Some truths and rationale first:
- Speculative assets sit at the top of the risk stack.
- When constraints emerge, speculative assets are sold together.
- In stressed regimes, capital loses the capacity to discriminate.
- Correlation is a measure of constraint.

In healthy markets, speculative assets are allowed to diverge:
- Some narratives attract capital.
- Some narratives break or fade.

Capital is discriminates and selects for "the most promising story." In stressed markets, this very discrimination collapses. Narratives, roadmaps, and promises all zero out — become irrelevant. Speculative assets are treated less as speculative assets and as a single liability on the balance sheet. At this point, correlation spikes close to 1 not because these assets are related in some fundamental sense, but because capital behavior has aligned uniformly.

Prima exists to observe this state transition.

Above is a snapshot of the complete Star Forger system, from Prima to Constalis. Notice the October spike in speculative activity. Notice also, Prima's corresponding spike prior to Constalis. Observe how correlation rises **before** visible, sustained damage in speculative pricing. This is a recurring behavior. Although Prima does not map 1:1 to Constalis or Star Forger, sustained levels of elevated correlation assumes change in behavior before said change manifests.

# INTERPRETATION
## CORRELATION REGIMES
1. Low Correlation
   - Speculative assets behave independently.
   - Capital is discriminating.
   - Narratives / stories diverge.
   - Market is tolerating or willingly funding uncertainty.
   - Risk appetite is healthy / expanding.
2. Rising Correlation
   - Selectivity is degrading.
   - Liquidity is tightening.
   - Capital is beginning or has started to de-risk.
   - Fear is beginning or has started to enter the system.
   - Rising correlation oftentimes precedes visible price damage.
3. High / Sustained Correlation
   - Speculative assets are treated identically.
   - Liquidation is forced.
   - Constraints are active.
   - Risk appetite is severely impaired.
   - Market is no longer funding / tolerating uncertainty.
## BEHAVIORAL CONTEXT
- Rising correlation with flat prices is oftentimes an early indicator of regime change.
- Rising correlation with rising prices confirms market risk appetite expanding.
- Rising correlation with falling prices confirms stress.
- Falling correlation after a spike oftentimes signals stabilization; recovery is not guaranteed.

Prima does not require a macro crisis to measure change in speculative behavior. Reduced tolerance for uncertainty, higher funding costs, or localized leverage unwinds are all sufficient inputs for the system.

# ADDITIONAL NOTES
1. Prima is intended to be behavioral, not statistical.
2. Correlation spikes often occur before price drawdowns / rallies, not after.
3. High correlation does not imply imminent crash. It simply implies constraint / alignment.
4. Prima is not a timing tool.
5. Prima is best interpreted alongside the base Star Forger index and Constalis:
   - Star Forger: Is speculation historically supported?
   - Prima: Is speculation being treated systemically?
   - Constalis: Where does recent behavior sit in context?
