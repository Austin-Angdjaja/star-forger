# STAR FORGER
A discretionary market sentiment project for gauging fear, greed, and fragility.

## CONTEXT
My first problem was defining fear and greed in markets. Although I could have settled for the classic route and defined fear as "stock goes down," greed as "stock goes up," and labeled everything in between "neutral," I thought there was perhaps a better approach.

At any given moment, there are a number of speculative stocks whose price is purely propped up on future expectations of profitability, breakthroughs, or partnerships. An example: OKLO.

Oklo Inc. is advertised as a company in the business of developing fission reactors. Despite having existed since 2013, Oklo has never once made a dollar in revenue, let alone profit. Furthermore, Oklo has never once demonstrated a live product sample or any prototype of said product besides 3D models, rendering, and computer-generated depictions.

Oklo, today, is valued at 15B market cap.

The company's stock is almost entirely priced on potential AI partnerships, breakthroughs in fission technology, and the chance of scaling into an industry giant with first-mover advantage and monopoly. This, we can then conclude, is the very definition of speculative.

My idea then was to take a bundle of these highly speculative companies, and somewhat use them as a gauge — the logic being, if the market is truly fearful at the moment, then the price of these speculative companies will show. In times of uncertainty and maximum fear, logic dictates you liquidate the highest risk positions first. The reverse should stand true.

Whether or not this logic actually holds, is debatable.

## METHODOLOGY
The methodology was quite simple:
- Curate a bundle of highly speculative assets.
- Construct a pseudo-ETF to aggregate speculative risk into an observable instrument.
- Standardize returns.
- Track pseudo-ETF changes daily.
- Track a rolling window of said pseudo-ETF changes daily.
- Track correlation of said pseudo-ETF.

The pseudo-ETF itself gives us a historical view of overall market conditions during periods of greed / fear, a rolling window gives us a more "recent" scale, and correlation implies changes in regime — possibly monetizable.

Star Forger is not designed to predict explicit market direction, but to identify shifts in risk appetite / speculative tolerance.

## INTERPRETATION
"Be fearful when others are greedy; be greedy when others are fearful," so the old adage goes. The intent of Star Forger is to gauge market extremes, and it does so by:
- Standardizing greed and fear as a historical index. When the index climbs / drops to either ends of historical highs / lows, market fragility and narrative decay manifests.
- Standardizing greed and fear in more recent context. As the market changes with time, what is considered extremely fearful / greedy in today's environment changes as well. The historical and rolling window combination allows for a more nuanced perspective.
- Standardizing volume of activity within constituents in the index. Elevated volume pre-dates regime change.
- Measuring correlation change over time. Correlation spike / decay are indicators of regime change.

It is important to note: interpretation is discretionary and often subject to the operator's judgement.

## INTEGRATION
Interpretation and integration is subject to the operator's discretion. Rising correlation reflects indiscriminate selling and risk compression; declining correlation signals differentiation and risk appetite returning. Buying during periods of weakness is advantageous. Selling during periods of strength is preferred.

The Star Forger index itself may be employed to gauge market sentiment. Extreme speculation may be an indicator to trim positions or hedge conservatively. Conversely, extreme fear may be an indicator to establish positions or size up.

## FUTURE ITERATIONS
Future iterations may add onto, or remove established features. The system is incomplete by nature, and Star Forger does not claim superiority to the CNN Fear or Greed index. It is simply an alternative I devised due to a specific need, and the lack of tools to fill said need.
