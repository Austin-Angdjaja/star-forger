# SYMPTOMS
As the old man says, "be greedy when others are fearful; be fearful when others are greedy." The problem, of course, is determining when exactly the market is fearful or otherwise. Most people equate fear with, "stock goes down," and greed with, "stock goes up." Anything in between is neutral. I find this lack of nuance and surface-level analysis quite troubling. Stocks can go up or down or sideways for any number of reason. To issue a blanket statement that the market is fearful simply because the index fell -3% on any given day fails to address the underlying as a whole. Star Forger argues that fear can be gauged another way.

# THE NATURE OF SPECULATION
The nature of speculation is that of uncertainty. We do not know what the future holds, and more importantly, we do not know what we do not know. To a certain extent, speculation is oftentimes confused with simply "hoping for the best" — gambling. I disagree. There are degrees to speculation.
- Informed speculation, where information synthesis provides asymmetric odds.
- Pure speculation, where the odds are unknown and information is sparse.

Informed speculation takes the form of making educated decisions based on known knowns. For instance, if you understand supply chain dynamic, then you understand that a "temporary choke" is just that — temporary — and any price spike is simply dislocation and prone to mean reversion. In this case, your speculation is confined to timing the drop, because the drop is all but guaranteed.

Pure speculation takes the form of gambling. For instance, investing in a company that has existed for a decade, has made exactly 0 dollars in revenue, has no product, has flexible roadmaps, and has made no significant advancements even after years of operation, is simply gambling on the future. You are not buying into the company per se, but into the company's narrative — the business it **intends** to become. In this case, your speculation is rife with risk. There is no edge — you are simply hoping.

It is this very hope in markets that we intend to synthesise into signal.

# SPECULATION AS SIGNAL
At any given moment, there is a number of stocks in the market that are purely speculative. These companies:
- Have no product.
- Have no revenue.
- Have (oftentimes) existed for years.
- Have flexible roadmaps.
- Have questionable management.
- Are reliant on narrative to prop share prices.

Markets treat these stocks as pseudo venture capitalism, whereby both risk and reward is extreme. In times of fear, what is the most logical course of action? Funds de-risk, investors run, longs capitulate.

Which positions do you de-risk from? Which positions do you sell first?

Obviously the most risky ones. When the market is on fire, you naturally migrate to defensive sectors — healthcare, utilities, consumer staples. 

You sell growth; you buy value.

Conversely, when the market is performing, you migrate back into aggressive sectors — tech, discretionary, energy.

You sell value; you buy growth.

This is the fundamental reality of investing, and to a certain extent, trading.

Star Forger maintains then that we can distill purely speculative stock's pricing into signal.

> If the market is supporting, and willingly pushing up the price of purely speculative investments, then it stands to reason that appetite for risk is present. The market is neutral or greed-leaning. Conversely, if the market is punishing purely speculative investments, and the price shows drastic daily / weekly declines, then it stands to reason that appetite for risk is not present. The market is neutral or fear-leaning.

> The problem, of course, is that individual companies are subject to individual problems. A speculative company may run out of funding — dead. A speculative company may lose the trust of markets — dead. A speculative company may be committing fraud — also dead. The solution is to then bundle a number of speculative companies into a single, measurable instrument — a pseudo-ETF, and track said pseudo-ETF.

# AUTHOR'S NOTE
Obviously, it goes without saying — logic and rationale might stray from reality. This isn't exactly me proclaiming that CNN's classic Fear and Greed index is inferior, rather, this is my own personal take on such system, and one that compliments frameworks, logic, rationale, and decision making inherent to me.
