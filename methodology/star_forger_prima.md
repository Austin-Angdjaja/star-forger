# CORE LOGIC
Whereas Star Forger aims to simply measure speculation in markets, Star Forger: Prima intends to measure how speculation fails.
- Price tells us what is happening currently.
- Volume tells us with what intent.
- Correlation tells us whether failure is isolated or systemic.

Prima is the correlation layer of Star Forger. It measures the degree to which purely speculative assets begin to move in lockstep, not because they are related on some fundamental or sectoral level, but because they are being treated the same by capital.

The premise is simple:
> When fear enters the system, distinction and nuance collapses before prices do.

# STAR FORGER: PRIMA
In a healthy market, speculative assets are allowed to behave independently of one another.
- Narratives diverge.
- Capital discriminates.
- Some stories work; others don't.

Correlation is low in this regime because the market is allowed to stop and think. Some companies may pose more alluring narratives than others. As a result, their share price will appreciate relative to alike speculative assets in the field. Other companies may form partnerships with highly-regarded organizations, causing massive, overnight gaps on press release.

Under normal circumstances, markets are able to digest information in real time and distinguish which speculative assets are more "promising" than others. In stressed markets, this is simply not possible. 

Discrimination disappears.

Speculative assets are no longer valued based on merit, roadmap, narrative strength, or future promises. They are liquidated all the same. At that point, correlation spikes.

It can be reasoned then that correlation is not exactly a measure of relatedness, but as a measure of constraint. When everyone acts the same way at the same time with the same degree of violence, a constraint is breaking in real-time.

# CORRELATION AS SIGNAL
Prima measures intra-basket correlation among Star Forger constituents. This is intentional. What Prima does not do is:
- Measure correlation to the S&P broader index funds.
- Measure factor exposure.
- Measure sector / industry alignment.

Prima measures pure speculation being treated as a single risk unit by capital. When speculative correlation is:
- Low = markets selectively fund uncertainty.
- Rising = liquidity is tightening; de-risking is beginning / has started.
- High and sustained = forced liquidation and systemic fear persists.

This behavior oftentimes precedes visible, sustained price damage.

Correlation spikes are frequently observed:
- Before share, prolonged drawdowns.
- During volatility regime shifts.
- When leverage is being unwound quietly.

Prima therefore can be viewed as a leading stress indicator.

# RISK STACK HIERARCHY
Speculative assets generally sit at the top of the risk stack.

They are:
- Weakly collateralized.
- Weakly supported by fundamental aspects.
- Narrative-dependent.
- Liquidity-sensitive.
- Commonly held by levered / fast-money participants.

When constraints emerge — margin pressure, funding stress, macro shocks — and regimes shift, speculative assets are sold first and together. This collective, almost knee-jerk treatment is what Prima intends to detect. More importantly, this behavior does not necessarily require a macro crisis. It only requires reduced tolerance for uncertainty or increased cost of risk.

Prima responds to structural and psychological stress, in addition to the obvious headline events.

# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
There was deliberate effort on my part to limit exposure to:
- Static correlation matrices.
- Cross-asset factor models.
- Overfitting to historical crises.

As is with Star Forger, the objective isn't exactly precision, but early detection of regime change. Correlation is treated as behavioral outcome, not a statistical model. Prima is, and I can not stress this enough, not:
- A volatility proxy.
- A timing indicator.
- A crash predictor.
- A proxy for risk management.

It is, all things considered, a stress lens first and foremost. It seeks to tell us when the market stops tolerating diversity of failure.
