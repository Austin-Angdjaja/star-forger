# CORE LOGIC
Star Forger is a risk-appetite observer. It does not attempt to predict markets, price assets, or forecast returns. It is a measure of the market's willingness to sustain pure speculation. The system operates under a simple premise:

> Speculation collapses first when fear enters the system.

When markets are confident, speculative assets are supported, traded, and increasingly correlated. When markets are fearful, speculative assets are abandoned first, violently, and indiscriminately. In essence, when the mandate shifts from "returns" to "safety," asset pricing follows suit, and speculation is first to be culled.

# STAR FORGER
Star Forger's basket is composed of companies whose valuations are dominated by speculation rather than operating fundamentals or strategic necessity. Although not all companies in Star Forger are equally speculative, it is imperative the basket be as good a representation of pure speculation in markets as reasonably possible, hence, only a minority of constituents can be argued to possess some aspect of fundamental valuation. An overwhelming majority of companies selected, in one way or another, fall under the umbrella of purely borderline speculation. This basket then:
- Excludes defensives, value, and cash-flow-anchored businesses.
- Excludes obvious scam equities that mechanically decay regardless of economic cycle or regime.
- Excludes businesses with justifiable fundamental valuations.
- Excludes businesses demonstrating commercial viability / progress.
- Captures assets whose prices are sustained primarily by risk appetite.
Rather than tracking individual names, the basket is normalized and aggregated, producing a simple composite value series much like a regular ETF. This removes indiosyncratic noise and allows StarForger to **observe the collective behavior of speculation.**

This is important.

Individual companies are subject to individual problems. Comprising the index of multiple companies then insulates Star Forger from problems which may arise from company-specific black swans.

It is also equally important to note: the pseudo-ETF is not intended to be tradable or actionable. It is intended to be an instrument, through which speculation may be derived, distilled, and demonstrated in markets as a quantifiable value. What matters is not the price of this pseudo-ETF per se. What matters is the trajectory, the rate of change, and behavior relative to the market's history.

This is the Star Forger index.

# VOLUME AS INTENT
Price alone is insufficient as a signal. Markets may drift on low participation or lack of volume. It is this very issue that led to the incorporation of volume behavior into the Star Forger index. The system measures:
- Volume relative to each asset's own recent history.
- Aggregated volume behavior across the entire basket.

The logic is simple:
- Rising speculative pricing + rising volume = active risk engagement.
- Falling speculative pricing + rising volume = forced liquidation.
- Falling speculative pricing + falling volume = abandonment.

Volume spikes are normalized and aggregated into a basket-level participation index, allowing Star Forger to distinguish between healthy speculative appetite, crowded excess, or structural withdrawal of interest. Standardization of volume is critical. A one-off volume surge in a constituent will not overwhelm the measurement and produce false positives, whereas a volume surge in **all** constituents indicate a general market-wide risk-on appetite.

# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Star Forger intentionally avoids rigid mechanical classification and black-box optimization processess. Judgement is not a flaw in the system, but rather a requirement. You may have noticed that Star Forger seems relatively simple in contrast to other such quantitative projects. That is partly the objective.

The goal is signal integrity, not a false sense of precision.

As a discretionary operator first and foremost, I understand markets are not clean. I have designed Star Forger to observe them regardless and synthesize data into information.

I can not stress this enough, Star Forger is not:
- A predictor / indicator.
- A trading strategy.
- A sentiment poll.
- A volatility index.

Star Forger exists to solely answer one question:
> Is the market currently willing to fund uncertainty and speculation?

Interpretation of the index and it's subsidiaries are in service of this question.
