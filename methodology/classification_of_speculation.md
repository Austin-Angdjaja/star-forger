# CLASSIFICATION OF SPECULATION
It is imperative we are able to distinguish purely speculative companies from start-ups and other such ventures. Some traits of purely speculative companies include, but are not excluded to:
- No meaningful / recurring revenue.
- No commercially viable product / service.
- No commercial progress.
- Listed for years (not recently IPO'd).
- Flexible roadmaps.
- Questionable management.
- Questionable corporate action.

The intent is not to mechanically, systemically differentiate start-ups from speculative companies. The intent is to develop a sense for companies that are more interested in propping up their share price — selling the narrative — rather than developing the business itself. In a sense, all companies have **some** aspect of speculation embedded in their valuation. What we are filtering for is companies where speculation is an overwhelming **majority** of valuation. The distinction matters.

Also an equally important caveat: we are **not** filtering for scam stocks. Scam stocks differ from purely speculative companies, and purely speculative companies differ from start-ups and ventures and such. The tell is usually in dilution and split history. Scam stocks aggressively dilute shareholders and initiate reverse splits at absurd ratios. This is how some stocks have peaks of millions and billions and trillions of dollars — by outright stealing from shareholders.

# THE IMPORTANCE OF CLASSIFICATION
Since we are intending to construct an instrument, the constituent of which is pure speculation, it would only make sense then to filter for anything that **is not** said pure speculation. I understand no stock's price is comprised of pure speculation, however, we can filter — as reasonably possible — so as to optimize signal integrity. In order to filter, however, we can not rely on strict criteria and systematize the process; some amount of judgement is necessary.

Examples of judgement include:
- Deciding what qualifies as commercial progress.
- Deciding whether a roadmap is flexible or simply conservative.
- Deciding whether management has shareholder's best interests in mind.
- Deciding whether corporate action aligns with objectives.
